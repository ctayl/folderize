# Pages
Pages is a plugin for the Buildfire mobile app development platform, which allows non technical professionals to quickly build mobile apps with no coding required.

Add as many pages as you want: all the Pages are rendered as a full screen carosuel, with a configurable navigation menu. Add any amout of content to each page, in whatever order you want! Pages and their content appear in a draggable list, and can be resorted by dragging the list items. 

Pages is highly configurable: add background images, colors/overlays, nav icons, change text sizes and more!
